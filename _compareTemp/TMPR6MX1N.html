I was responsible for the HTML, CSS, and jQuery coding as well as training the client on how to use the custom CMS that was built for them by a .Net programmer.

               <p>My design career formally started in 1999. I say "formally" because I have been drawing and designing on a computer since I was about six years old. My father was a networking guy so we always had the latest technologies in the home. Due to decades of practice, I'm steadier using a mouse than a pencil.
<br><br>
My first job was creating interactive CD-Roms for various industries using Macromedia Director (yes I'm dating myself) and coding in Lingo. When flash hit the market, I made the transition from desktop applications to the web. Until recently I was primarily a Flash designer and an ActionScript developer. Currently my focus has been on jQuery, jQuery mobile, and trying to master responsive and liquid design layouts. I'm also having fun learning LESS, PHP, and using GitHub.I have extensive experience with large, content rich sites and am exceptional with the design and production of medium and small sites as well. 
<br><br>
Outside of the web world I enjoy an active lifestyle. I love all the things Colorado has to offer, including camping, snowboarding and anything else that requires me to be outside. PDF Resume
